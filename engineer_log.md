[Step 0] Action: chk | Result: Goal Alignment: Lacking ability to design, implement, and deploy end-to-end AI systems and integrate models into production environments. | Reasoning: Based on the reflection, I have capabilities for specific AI inference tasks but missing broader AI engineering skills such as system design, full-stack integration, model deployment pipelines, data engineering, and the ability to build and maintain production-ready AI applications. This gap prevents reaching full AI Engineer status.
[Step 1] Action: log | Result: Log recorded | Reasoning: I identified gaps in system design, model deployment, data engineering, and production‑ready AI applications. My hypothesis proposes a multi‑faceted autonomous pattern—structured learning, practical projects, mentorship, incremental development, and ongoing reflection—to systematically acquire and apply the missing AI engineering capabilities.
[Step 2] Action: fmt | Result: ### ANALYSIS ###
The single most critical failure point is the inability to design, implement, and deploy end-to-end AI systems and integrate models into production environments. | Reasoning: The reflection highlights a significant gap in my capabilities as an AI Engineer, particularly in system design, model deployment, and production-ready AI applications. This failure point is critical because it encompasses a broad range of skills necessary for a full-stack AI engineer, including system design, data engineering, and the ability to integrate models into production environments. Addressing this gap is essential to achieving the goal of becoming a proficient AI Engineer.
[Step 3] Action: mut | Result: Core Rules Redefined | Reasoning: retry
[Step 4] Action: log | Result: Log recorded | Reasoning: The reflection highlighted a significant gap in my AI engineering capabilities, specifically the inability to design, implement, and deploy end-to-end AI systems and integrate models into production environments. This is critical because it encompasses a broad range of necessary skills. The analysis identified this as the single most critical failure point. The proposed solution is a structured, multi-faceted learning and development approach to acquire the missing skills and achieve full AI Engineer proficiency.
[Step 5] Action: align | Result: Gap: The most critical missing capability is the implementation of the intellectual‑honesty mechanisms—specifically the `fn_5_chk` function to assess alignment and the `fn_7_mut` function to mutate rules when alignment falls below 80%—because without these self‑validation and self‑modification tools the agent cannot evaluate or recursively improve toward the 100 % autonomy goal defined in agents.md. | Proposed patch committed as main_patch.py — Saved_201 | Reasoning: retry
