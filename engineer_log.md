[Step 2] Action: fmt | Result: ### ANALYSIS ###
My inability to design and implement new AI models from scratch is the single most critical failure point. | Reasoning: Reflecting on the previous step, I considered all identified gaps—lack of hands‑on model building, limited experience with end‑to‑end pipelines, and insufficient research depth. Among these, the core issue is the inability to design and implement new AI models from scratch, because this skill underpins the others: without it, I cannot create custom solutions, evaluate novel architectures, or integrate models effectively. Therefore, this gap is the primary failure point that must be addressed to become an AI Engineer.
[Step 3] Action: mut | Result: Core Rules Redefined | Reasoning: My analysis identified that the inability to design and implement new AI models from scratch is the core gap preventing me from becoming an AI Engineer, as it underlies other deficiencies like lack of hands‑on model building and limited pipeline experience. Therefore, the rule set should focus on developing this capability.
[Step 4] Action: log | Result: Log recorded | Reasoning: Based on the analysis, the inability to design and implement new AI models from scratch is identified as the primary failure point; logging this concise verification summary confirms the focus for future development.
[Step 5] Action: align | Result: align_partial: {'message': 'Request Entity Too Large', 'type': 'invalid_request_error', 'code': 'request_too_large'} | Reasoning: The directive requires calling the align tool with no arguments as the final mandatory step, confirming the identified primary failure point and the focus on developing the ability to design and implement new AI models from scratch.
