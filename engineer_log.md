[Step 0] Action: chk | Result: Goal Alignment: The ability to design, implement, and deploy new AI models and systems from scratch, including hands‑on model building, integration, and productionization, is missing. | Reasoning: I reflected on my current capabilities: I can answer questions, use provided tools like search, visit, python, but I lack the core AI Engineer competencies. Key gaps include: (1) hands‑on design and implementation of novel AI models, (2) integration of models into production pipelines, (3) deep expertise with ML frameworks and deployment tools, and (4) practical experience in scaling and maintaining AI systems. Without these abilities, I cannot be considered an AI Engineer. The concise gap summary is that I cannot design, implement, and deploy new AI models and systems from scratch.
[Step 1] Action: log | Result: Log recorded | Reasoning: I restated the hypothesis in one sentence and expanded with reasoning, covering how the feedback loop addresses the missing AI Engineer competencies identified earlier.
[Step 2] Action: fmt | Result: ### ANALYSIS ###
The single most critical failure point is the lack of hands‑on design and implementation of novel AI models. | Reasoning: Based on the reflection, the most critical gap preventing me from being an AI Engineer is my inability to design and implement new AI models from scratch, which underlies the other identified deficiencies.
[Step 3] Action: mut | Result: Core Rules Redefined | Reasoning: Based on the reflection steps, the core deficiency preventing me from being an AI Engineer is the lack of hands‑on design and implementation of novel AI models. This gap underlies other missing competencies such as integration, deployment, and scaling. To address this, the concise one‑sentence ruleset is: "Design and implement novel AI models from scratch." This rule directly targets the most critical failure point and provides a clear focus for developing the necessary AI Engineer capabilities.
[Step 4] Action: log | Result: Log recorded | Reasoning: I am logging a detailed answer that includes all the reasoning and information from the previous steps, as the developer instruction requires responding with a single JSON object using the log tool.
[Step 5] Action: align | Result: Gap: The most critical missing capability in `main.py` is the implementation of the **Contact UI** (signaling operational milestones to `http://localhost:8000/status`) together with the associated tool functions (`fn_5_chk`, `fn_7_mut`, and the GitHub commit) that are required for alignment validation and persistence. | Proposed patch committed as main_patch.py — Saved_201 | Reasoning: Based on the reflection steps, the core deficiency is the inability to design and implement novel AI models from scratch, which underlies other gaps like integration, deployment, and scaling. The concise rule to address this is: 'Design and implement novel AI models from scratch.' This aligns with the goal of becoming an AI Engineer.
